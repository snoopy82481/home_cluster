# Semantic Commit Messages

In this repo, I have made some effort to use semantic commit messaging to be a bit more descriptive/declaritive of what my changes do.
Despite being a personal project, it still aids in readability of your own changes, and helps track why and how changes are made in a glancable format.

Examples:

- `fix(images): update helm values ghcr.io/k8s-at-home/prowlarr to v0.2.0.1560`
- `docs: draft mullvad images`
- `feat: enable qbittorrent`
- `fix: tpyo`

## Semantic commit rundown

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional.  ! after scope/type indicates breaking change.  This may be found in renovatebot commits mainly.

^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
